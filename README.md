# ML Algorithms with GUI

**This Tkinter-based app allows users to upload CSV files, preprocess data, and apply machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Neural Network, KNN for classification, Linear Regression for regression, and K-Means for clustering. It displays metrics and visualizes  results, offering an interface for machine learning tasks**
## Features

- **Implemented Algorithms:**
  - Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
  - Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, etc.
  - Deep Learning (Optional): Integration with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Interactive GUI:**
  - Built using libraries such as `Tkinter`, `PyQt`, or others.
  - Easy input of dataset, parameter tuning, and visualization of results.
- **Visualization:**
  - Plots for training/validation performance.
  - Decision boundaries for classifiers.
  - Data distribution and clustering visuals.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NASO7Y/ML_algorithms_with_GUI.git
   cd ML_algorithms_with_GUI
   ```
